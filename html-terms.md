**HTML** stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage. A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks.

**Element** — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by tags and the text or media it contains. HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content.

**Tag** is a set of characters constituting a formatted command for a web page.

Opening Tag — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.

Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.

HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships.
When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the *child* of that element. The child element is said to be nested inside of the *parent* element.
*Hierarchy* - the relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements.

**Attributes** can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element to change its default behavior or provide additional data about it.  Attributes are made up of the following two parts:
- The name of the attribute
- The value of the attribute

< p > - paragraph element = TAG and CONTENT in between

< p >< span > - відокремити частину тексту, але не розділ

< body >
< h1 > - heading largest, < h6 > - smallest
  
< div > division or a container that divides the page into sections. < div >s allow us to group HTML elements to apply the same styles for all HTML elements inside
id="text" - attribute identify
< em > - emphasize - italic
< strong > - highlight = bold
< br > - spacing
< ul > < li > < /li > < /ul > - unordered list
< ol > < li > < /li > < /ol > - ordered list
< img src="" alt="" / > - src - URL, alt - image description

< video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls >
  Video not supported
< /video > - The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls such as pausing and playing.  The text, Video not supported, between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.
